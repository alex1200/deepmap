The vines are not the usual continuous vine scroll. Instead the lozenges are formed of four vines, one creating each side of the diamond, and each ending in a heart shaped leaf. Between each lozenge are groups of four dots, probably representing simplified rosettes, with leaf life forms reflected above and below. The figural design consists of very thin, simple lines that resemble embroidery. Plain/tabby woven undyed linen appears above and below each red band. The linen warps appear to be paired in the areas tapestry weave. The smaller fragment is stitched to a purple and black woven tape band. Perhaps these fragments come from a linen tunic: the smaller fragment may come from a sleeve band and might exhibit selvedges.","dateoflastpageview":"2018-08-18","dateoffirstpageview":"2012-09-04","primaryimageurl":"https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:CARP06699_dynmc","dated":"8th-10th century","contextualtextcount":0,"period":"Byzantine period","url":"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/99827","publicationcount":0,"images":[{"iiifbaseuri":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/18720602","baseimageurl":"https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:CARP06699_dynmc","idsid":"18720602","displayorder":1,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"CARP06699"}],"objectid":99827,"culture":"Byzantine","verificationleveldescription":"Unchecked.
